# etch-a-sketch

This is an etch-a-sketch made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This was an exercise in event listeners, DOM manipulation, and prompts. The etch-a-sketch allows for custom grid dimensions, a random-color mode, and an erase mode.

NOTE: due to Git errors, previous versions of this project were lost. This version was originally uploaded on February 15th.

FURTHER CHANGES
1. Shade-in button (10% darker with each mouseover event)
2. Color picker button
3. Make the rainbow feature more "rainbow" - only allow a certain range of colors
4. Expand CSS (perhaps mimic a real etch-a-sketch?)
